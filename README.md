## Usage
You can use this package like any other packages:

### `npm run build-storybook`
First you must run this command, After executing this command, it will give you a built-in version.

### `npm pack`
Now by executing this command, it will give you a *.tgz file that you can put in your project.

You can use it by adding the link of this package inside the package.json :

```json
  "dependencies": {
    "design-system": "file: ./react-design-system-0.1.0.tgz"
  },
```
Now, after executing the `npm install` or `npm install design-system` command, you can use it anywhere in the project.

Enjoy it ðŸ™‚.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run storybook`

Runs the design system in the localhost.\
Open [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build-storybook`

Builds the design system to the `storybook-static` folder.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point youâ€™re on your own.

You donâ€™t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldnâ€™t be useful if you couldnâ€™t customize it when you are ready for it.
